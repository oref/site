    <h2>Silicon Blood is a traditional sci-fi roguelike.</h2>
    <p>I've been working on this game for a few months after I became incredibly interested in procedural generation after reading a lot about
    Caves of Qud and Dwarf Fortress. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.</p>

    <p>
        The theme and core mechanics have still yet to be decided as currently there isn't much of a 'game' to play however I'll be updating this page
        and my blog with any interesting write-ups or noteworthy achievments during the course of development. You can keep up to date with the project by
        either starring or watching it on <a href="https://github.com/oref/SiliconBlood" target="_blank">Github</a> Or by joining the <em>new</em>
